### Goal

Input closet -> Run algorithm -> Get outfits for the day

### Basic algorithm

1. Create nodes for all clothing items
2. Calculate weights based on ruleset
3. Generate paths of complete fits using Dijkstra's graph algorithm

### Ex:

The weather is 57 degrees - warm enough for most clothes. I recommend one of the following:
Stussy Our Legacy T Shirt, 517 Orange Tabs, Nike White Air Forces
Yeezy Gap Black Hoodie, Black Blank T Shirt, Dickies Black Double Knee, Suicoke Mura-V Slides
Helmut Lang Lava Logo Hoodie, White Blank T Shirt, Dickies Black Double Knee, Doc Marten Black 1461
